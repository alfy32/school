Assignemt 5 - Closest Pair
==========================

This graph shows each solution (naive, slow divide and conquer, fast divide and conquer) run against each disrtibution of points.

As we can see the naive(n^2) algorithm doesn't change with the different distributions. This is what I expected. It doesn't matter where the data is compared to each other. The algorithm compares every point to every other point.
